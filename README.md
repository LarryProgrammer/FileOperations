The following is a list of scores for a game. Enter them into a text file.
14401 3094 39201 57192 4948 55854 84 95 430 5502 65816 4994 7712
The program opens the file, reads in each score as an integer, and remembers the highest score. 
After all the scores have been read, output the high score (65816 in this example, but it could be different if the file had different scores in it).
